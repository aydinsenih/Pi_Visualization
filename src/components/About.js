            The number π (/paɪ/; spelled out as "pi") is a mathematical
            constant, approximately equal to 3.14159. It is defined in Euclidean
            geometry[a] as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
            diameter, and also has various equivalent definitions. The number
            appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics.
            The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio
            of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh
            mathematician William Jones in 1706.[1] It is also referred to as
            Archimedes's constant.
